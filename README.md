# auto-edge
Python program that automatically does a certain number of Microsoft Edge searches with the goal being achieving the daily amount of Bing rewards points.

This program assures the maximum amount of points irrespective of level (Level 1 or Level 2).

Program isn't targetted at developed countries but rather underdeveloped countries with less points per search.

For level 2 you get 90+12 points (112 points) and for level 1 you get 30+3 points (33 points) *daily.*

All values are editable so that the program can be used for developed countries as well.

**Disclaimer: Use this program at your own risk as botting does go against the terms of use.**
